# Classifying-Tumor-vs-Normal-tissues-in-Breast-Cancer-using-CNN-on-Gene-expression-images
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumor and normal samples using RNA-Seq gene expression data from TCGA. Gene expression profiles are transformed into treemap-encoded images and analyzed using a CNN, with performance compared against a Random Forest baseline.
